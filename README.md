# Object-Localization-and-Classification
 Using deep learning techniques we can create a model that can accomplish both classification and Locating the traffic sign in a street view(Localization)  at once with multi output methods.
### Data Preparation:
Using the real life images with street views or backgrounds in order to better simulate actual views self-driving cars may encounter for classification, in order to get the bounding box information (coordinates), each image is annotated manually.
Generated python script to extract the annotated XML files and create a csv
